# CubeSat-EM-Material-Discharge-Eval
ECEN 403 904 Capstone Team 44 

For this project, we are tasked to design and develop the first prototype of Orbital Arc's RIOT Drive or CubeSat.

We divided it into 4 separate subsystems and at the end integrated each subsystem accordingly.

The Chassis and Modeling subsystem is designed to hold the integrated PCB as well as the accelerator plates that are designed.

The accelerator modeling subsystem helps with the design of the accelerator plate that would be mounted onto the CubeSat.
Simulations were performed amongst 3 different geometries and 3 different materials in order to see which iteration of 
the plate would fit well within the CubeSat's standards. 

The Power circuit subsystem takes the input voltage and converts the voltage to power the components within the system.
