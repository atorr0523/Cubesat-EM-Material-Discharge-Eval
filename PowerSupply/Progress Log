Power Supply Progress Log
Week of 9/18 - 9/22

9/19/23
Changes were made to the subsystem, Ian used to be the one to handle this part of the project but now Alejandro will take care of this.

9/22/23
Met with Johnathan (sponsor) and received some materials from him; gained a better understanding of the project as well and will look more into this subsystem 

Week of 10/2 - 10/6

10/2/2023 & 10/3/2023
Researched some ICs using Webench to come up with some circuits to deliver the required voltages/currents/Power to the components for our project

Found that the LM2595 - ADJ can be used as a buck converter to buck the 24V Input to 3.3V with a current of 0.3A and power of about 1W to power the
microcontroller and the digital-to-analog converter.

10/7-10/27

Worked on PCB on Altium designer, went to design blitz to receive help, and finished PCB on 10/24. Ordering PCB on 10/24.




2-01-2024 - 2-05-2024
Time allotted: 7 hours
Worked on finding components for the new buck and boost converters. Transferring configurations on an Altium schematic and now routing PCB.

2-07-2024
Time allotted: 2 hours
Worked on Tracing PCB configuration in Altium and putting parts in the Excel sheet to order. 



3/1/2024 - 3/3/2024 (Capstone Blitz)
3/1
Finished rerouting new PCB design
time allotted: 4 hours

3/2
E-Load Tested Buck converter which converts 24V to 5V and plotted the data. 
Then tried testing this buck converter to see if it can power the MCU which did not end up working. 
Tried an old design that converted 24V to 3.3V which actually got the MCU to work as intended. 

On the Altium software, changed one of the buck converter configurations to buck down to 3.3V now. 
Rerouted PCB file once again. 

Now starting integration with MCU. 

Time allotted: 8 hours

3/3
Worked on the Altium Schematic and communicated with Josh to try and integrate the MCU into the schematic and the PCB document. 
Ran into some problems when integrating so am now trying to overcome these problems. 

Time allotted: 5 hours
