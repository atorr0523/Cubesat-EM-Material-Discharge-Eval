Power Supply Progress Log
Week of 9/18 - 9/22

9/19/23
Changes were made to the subsystem, Ian used to be the one to handle this part of the project but now Alejandro will take care of this.

9/22/23
Met with Johnathan (sponsor) and received some materials from him; gained a better understanding of the project as well and will look more into this subsystem 

Week of 10/2 - 10/6

10/2/2023 & 10/3/2023
Researched some ICs using Webench to come up with some circuits to deliver the required voltages/currents/Power to the components for our project

Found that the LM2595 - ADJ can be used as a buck converter to buck the 24V Input to 3.3V with a current of 0.3A and power of about 1W to power the
microcontroller and the digital-to-analog converter.
