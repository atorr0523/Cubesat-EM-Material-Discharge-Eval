Power Supply Progress Log
Week of 9/18 - 9/22

9/19/23
Changes were made to the subsystem, Ian used to be the one to handle this part of the project but now Alejandro will take care of this.

9/22/23
Met with Johnathan (sponsor) and received some materials from him; gained a better understanding of the project as well and will look more into this subsystem 

Week of 10/2 - 10/6

10/2/2023 & 10/3/2023
Researched some ICs using Webench to come up with some circuits to deliver the required voltages/currents/Power to the components for our project

Found that the LM2595 - ADJ can be used as a buck converter to buck the 24V Input to 3.3V with a current of 0.3A and power of about 1W to power the
microcontroller and the digital-to-analog converter.

10/7-10/27

Worked on PCB on Altium designer, went to design blitz to receive help, and finished PCB on 10/24. Ordering PCB on 10/24.




2-01-2024 - 2-05-2024
Time allotted: 7 hours
Worked on finding components for the new buck and boost converters. Transferring configurations on an Altium schematic and now routing PCB.

2-06-2024
Time allotted: 2 hours
Worked on Tracing PCB configuration in Altium and putting parts in the Excel sheet to order.
