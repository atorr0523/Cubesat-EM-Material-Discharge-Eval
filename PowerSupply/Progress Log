Changes were made to the subsystem, Ian used to be the one to handle this part of the project but now Alejandro will take care of this.
Now the question is where to go from here.
What requirements to look at:
  - Mass of the circuit should be less than 200 grams
      -What battery do we use then?
  - Voltage testing has been scaled down to 10-50 Volts
  - 24 or 48 V input and power budget of 25W, not including ionizer
  - Must fit within 1 unit of a cubesat (not more than 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm), ideally should
    target a form factor that fits within 0.2 units (0.2 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm)
