What requirements to look at:
  - Mass of the circuit should be less than 200 grams
      -What battery do we use then?
  - Voltage testing has been scaled down to 10-50 Volts (potentially)
  - 24 or 48 V input and power budget of 25W, not including ionizer
  - Must fit within 1 unit of a cubesat (not more than 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm), ideally should
    target a form factor that fits within 0.2 units (0.2 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm)
