Altium files for the Power Supply PCB needed to power the following Components:

Ionizer chips
  - Powered from the boost converter which converts the 24V input to 48V with a current of 0.62A

Thermionic Cathodes
  - Powered from the buck converter which converts the 24V input to 5V. There are 4 thermionic cathodes each receiving the same voltage. The power needed for 
  of these components ranges from 1-3W.
  - 1 buck converter used for this

Microcontroller
  - Powered from another buck converter which converts the 24V input to 3.3V with a current of 0.35A

Stepper Motor Controller
  -Powered from a separate buck converter which converts the 24V input to 5V with a current of 0.5A.
