In this folder is the project for the PIC microcontroller in MPLabxIDE.
Copy this folder to C:\Users\(Your name)\MPLABXProjects.
If you have not made an MPLab project before, you may not have this folder and will need to create it.
Opening MPLab should allow you to select this folder as a project.
You will need to install MPLab Code Composer (MCC) and MPLab Data Visualizer for USART and command line.
