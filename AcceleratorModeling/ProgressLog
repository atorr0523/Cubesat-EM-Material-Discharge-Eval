High Potential Accelerator Modeling
9/18 - 9/22
-We have decided that Michael Kim is doing this subsystem. 
Requirements:
-Accumulate and maintain an electrostatic potential up to 100kV at its surface.
-Find 3 materials and 3 geometries, so we are testing 9 material-geometry combinations.
   
-Make sure the combinations fit within a 100m x 100m face of a unit cubesat.


10/2 - 10/6
-We have finalized what materials and geometries we are using
    -Material 1: Teflon
    -Material 2: HDPE
    -Material 3: Polypropylene
    -Geometry 1: Circular Plate
    -Geometry 2: Hemisphere
    -Geometry 3: Cone
-We currently have teflon sheets for one material and are waiting for the other two to be acquired.
