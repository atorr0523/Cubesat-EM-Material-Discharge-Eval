High Potential Accelerator Modeling
9/18 - 9/22
-We have decided that Michael Kim is doing this subsystem. 
Requirements:
-Accumulate and maintain an electrostatic potential up to 100kV at its surface.
-Find 3 materials and 3 geometries, so we are testing 9 material-geometry combinations.
    -Material 1: Teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene)
    -Material 2:
    -Material 3:
    -Geometry 1:
    -Geometry 2:
    -Geometry 3:
-Make sure the combinations fit within a 100m x 100m face of a unit cubesat.
