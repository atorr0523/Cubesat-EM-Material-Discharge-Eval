Created new subsystems and reassigned to team
Researched Cubesat chassis distributors and brainstormed performance parameters to possibly model
Meeting with Jonathan (CEO) this Friday, will ask him about chassis specs and which parameters are highest priority

9/26/23

Submitted request for FEDC team for ordering parts and locker storage
Created initial parts list for components that will require extensive resources
Spoke with Jonathan about parameters to calculate, thermal and outgassing are crucial, radiation calculations next in priority
Beginning to finalize potential Cubesat distributors, need to get approval for Jonathan
Starting to prepare report for SATOP sponsors on project progress

10/3/23

Finalized choice of chassis to order, waiting on sponsor/capstone team for procurement
Debriefed presentation in class and prepared for progress presentation with sponsors on Friday (10/6)
